Mechatronics 1 Robot Code

The ArduinoDriveShooter code is uploaded to the arduino uno, while the ArduinoDriveCodeFindRed is uploaded to the arduino mega. The find red code incorporates side location algorithms so the robot can dynamically adjust to the side of the course it is on. The code was originally written in Python but was migrated over to arduino following difficulties with serial communication to a raspberry pi. The code is designed so that the arduino mega controls the primary functionality of the robot. This includes targeting, when to fire, and driving. The arduino uno executes shooter specific commands.
The design also included a graduate mechatronics project which integrated a sound system to add a fun extra touch to the robot. The sound system code is also provided.
